--- Assignment ---
------------------

Assignment 1 is started.



---------------
--- Project ---
---------------

Project is based on: http://echobase.freeiz.com/sticks/.
Link found through https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/mjukvarutestning/labs/assignment-2-xunit-testing/
Source code is written myself, as no knowledge of existing code is found.
The project contains a small game wherein the user chooses to draw between 1 or 3 sticks.
Afterwards, a computer opponent draws between 1 or 3 sticks. Then this repeats until last stick is drawn.
For now, the project contains 30 sticks to draw. The player that must draw the last stick loses.

--- Notes ---
-------------

JUnit works smoothly without any conflicts, no further notes required.
Code Coverage works, however not in combination with JUNit. Therefore CodeCover is used separately with the main method.
The main method will be adjusted so it can run the program manual and perform extra tests without the use of JUNit.
Mocking is not used yet, as for now I do not yet know how use it properly.
Mocking will be added later into the project therefore.
GitHub is used for storage of the project.

-------------------------
--- Package: complete ---
-------------------------

Contain a fully untested working version of the project.
This is version is made in order to decide what to project to make and how to test it.
Note that this version is mostly likely filled with bugs, but it's is only a prototype.
The real tested project will be contained within the main package: sticks within the src source folder.



-------------------------
--- Package: examples ---
-------------------------

Found within the tests source folder.
This package contains example tests, for testing purposes on how JUnit and Cover Cover works.
Also for uploading testing purposes for GitHub.
These files are only prototype files.
The real testing classes will be contained within the main package: sticks within the tests source folder.



-----------------------------
--- Current Progress Done ---
-----------------------------

Writing untested source code for project.
Testing JUnit with prototype example tests.
Restarting project.

--- TODO ---
------------

Writings tests for each function.
Rewriting the program again, with one function a time to test.
More items will be listed here.
